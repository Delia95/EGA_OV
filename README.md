# EGA_OV
The Painted Body Storage Resequencing (PBSR) problem is a critical optimization challenge in automobile manufacturing, aiming to enhance production efficiency by resequencing car bodies from the painting workshop to the assembly workshop while satisfying multiple objectives and constraints. In this paper, we propose an Enhanced Genetic Algorithm with Offset Vector (EGA-OV) to solve PBSR, integrating Offset Vector Representation and Prior Distribution Model to improve scheduling quality and strategy search efficiency. Furthermore, we design several heuristic-driven optimization mechanisms and conduct theoretical analyses to ensure the robustness and convergence of EGA-OV. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that EGA-OV outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.
